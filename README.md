Sales Dashboard â€“ Year-to-Date Analysis
Project Overview:
This sales dashboard is designed to provide a comprehensive overview of year-to-date performance across multiple markets and product categories. Built to enable strategic decision-making, the dashboard highlights key metrics such as sales, profit, and order quantity, along with market share distribution and customer acquisition trends. The dashboard serves as a vital tool for understanding both macro-level performance and granular category-based trends.

Key Metrics and Insights:

Sales KPI ($14.11M): This metric reflects the total sales achieved year-to-date, showing a 15.02% increase versus the previous year. The KPI allows businesses to track revenue growth and compare performance against historical data.
Profit KPI ($1.30M): Tracks the overall profit margin, indicating a slight decrease of 0.46% from the previous year. This KPI provides insight into the financial health of the company and highlights areas for potential cost optimization.
Order Quantity (0.16M): This metric represents the total number of orders placed during the year. With a 15.02% increase compared to the prior year, the company can track order volume growth and assess customer demand.
Market Share by Sales: The pie chart breaks down sales contributions by region. LATAM leads with 45.86% of total sales, followed by Europe at 43.37%. Smaller regions like Pacific Asia (8.32%) and Africa (2.25%) also contribute, showing a diverse global market presence.
Market-Wise Customer Acquisition: A line chart illustrates customer acquisition trends across five key regions (Africa, Europe, LATAM, Pacific Asia, USCA) throughout the year. By visually representing customer acquisition month by month, it provides a clear picture of market penetration and growth in different regions.
Sales Comparison by Category: This bar chart compares product categories, including Cardio Equipment, Fishing, Camping & Hiking, Water Sports, and Cleats. Each category's performance is visualized, showing whether sales are greater than, less than, or equal to the previous year, offering a clear view of product demand shifts.
Key Features:

Top 10 Products by Category: The dashboard features the top-performing products within each category, allowing the business to focus on its most profitable items. The analysis reveals which categories and products have gained or lost traction over time.
Market Trends and Sales Growth: Through consistent data analysis and visualization, the dashboard tracks market-wise sales growth, giving stakeholders a clear understanding of regional performance. LATAM and Europe are highlighted as dominant regions with consistently high sales contributions.
Actionable Insights on Profitability: The integration of profit margin and sales data allows for a deeper understanding of profitability across various regions and product categories. Negative trends in profit can be identified and addressed promptly, ensuring financial sustainability.
